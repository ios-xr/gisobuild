# How to Contribute

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Cisco's Golden ISO tool! Here are a
few general guidelines on contributing and reporting bugs that we ask you to
review.

## Reporting Issues

Before reporting a new issue, please ensure that the Issue was not already
reported or fixed by searching through our [Issues
list](https://github.com/ios-xr/gisobuild/issues).

When creating a new Issue, please be sure to include a **title and clear
description**, as much relevant information as possible, including, where
relevant:

- steps to reproduce
- a test case (correct/incorrect outcomes)

Similarly, please also raise one Issue for each task, and avoid using one Github
Issue to represent multiple bugs/feature requests.

**If you discover a security bug, please do not report it through GitHub.
Instead, please see security procedures in [SECURITY.md](/SECURITY.md).**

## Sending Pull Requests

Unfortunately, due to the release process for this tool, we are unable to accept
pull requests. Please raise an Issue if you have a problem, you are welcome to
include a proposed fix as part of that.

## Other Ways to Contribute

Please feel free to raise Issues for any problems you have encountered, or for
any features you want to request. You may also comment on other, existing
Issues, as any extra information is always appreciated!

Thanks again for your interest on contributing to Cisco's Golden ISO tool!
