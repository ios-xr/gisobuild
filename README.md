Utility to build Golden ISO for IOS-XR.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --iso ISO             Path to Mini.iso/Full.iso file
  --repo REPO [REPO ...]
                        Path to RPM repository. For LNT, user can specify
                        .rpm, .tgz, .tar filenames, or directories. RPMs are
                        only used if already included in the ISO, or specified

                        filenames can be specified to choose a particular
                        version of a package, the rest of the block that the
                        package is in will be included as well. Package names

  --full-iso            To build full iso only for xrv9k

LNT only build options:
  --remove-packages REMOVE_PACKAGES [REMOVE_PACKAGES ...]
                        Remove RPMs, specified in a comma separated list.
                        These are matched against user installable package
                        names, and must be the whole package name, e.g: xr-bgp
  --skip-usb-image      Do not build the USB image
  --copy-dir COPY_DIRECTORY
                        Copy built artefacts to specified directory if
                        provided. The specified directory must already exist,
                        be writable by the builder and must not contain a
                        previously built artefact with the same name.
  --clear-bridging-fixes
                        Remove all bridging bugfixes from the input ISO
  --verbose-dep-check   Verbose output for the dependency check.
  --debug               Output debug logs to console
  --isoinfo ISOINFO     User specified isoinfo executable to use instead of
                        the default version
  --image-script IMAGE_SCRIPT
                        User specified image.py script to be used for
                        packing/unpacking instead of the version extracted
                        from the ISO. It will not be inserted into the GISO.
                        Intended for debugging purposes only.

## Description

Typically Cisco releases IOS-XR software as a mini/base ISO which contains
mandatory IOS-XR packages for a given platform and separately a set of
optional packages and software patches for any bug fixes (SMU). 
Optional package and SMU are in RPM packaging format.

The Golden ISO tool creates an ISO containing the full contents of
the mini/base ISO together with optional packages and SMU of the user's
choice. Once the Golden ISO is created it can be used either for iPXE booting
a router or used for SU (system upgrade) from the current running version to
a new version of IOS-XR.

## Requirements

This tool has the following executable requirements:
* python3 >= 3.6
* rpm >= 4.14
* cpio >= 2.10
* gzip >= 1.9
* createrepo_c
* file
* isoinfo
* mkisofs
* mksquashfs
* openssl
* unsquashfs
* 7z (Optional - but functionality may be reduced without)

It also requires the following Python (>= 3.6) modules:
* dataclasses
* defusedxml
* distutils
* packaging
* rpm
* yaml

# Invocation

This tool can be run natively on a Linux host if the dependencies above are met.
Alternatively, the tool can also be run on a Linux system with Docker enabled
and the ability to pull the published 'cisco-xr-gisobuild' image from Docker
Hub, in which case the above dependencies are met by the published image.

To run natively on a Linux host, the following distributions have been tested.
* Alma Linux 8
* Fedora 34
* Debian 11.2

On a native Linux system, which does not have all dependencies met,
the tool dependencies can be installed on supported distributions above
by running the following command (possibly via sudo)
              
    ./setup/prep_dependency.sh

To load and run the pre-built cisco-xr-gisobuild docker image, ensure that the
docker service is enabled and it's possible to pull and run published docker
images.

Run the following command to check docker service parameters.

    docker info

Running the tool:

To run natively on a linux host which has dependency requirements met:

    ./src/gisobuild.py --iso <input iso> --repo <rpm repo1 rpm_repo2> \
        --pkglist <pkg1 pkg2 pkg3> --bridging-fixes <smu1 smu2 smu3> \
        --xrconfig <config.cfg> --ztp-ini <ztp.ini> --script <user_script.sh> \
        --label <label> --out-directory <out_directory> --clean

The tool has a helpful usage info which lists down the options supported.

When user does not want to specify the inputs via cli, an alternate would be to populate the yaml file template 
provided in the toolkit and pass the same via:

    ./src/gisobuild.py --yamlfile <input_yaml_cfg>

To override any input in the yaml config file, please use the corresponding cli option and parameter.

    ./src/gisobuild.py --yamlfile <input_yaml_cfg> --label <new_label>

The above command will override the label specified in yaml file with new option provided via cli option --label.

When the host machine does not have its dependency met, but allows pulling and running docker images, enable 
docker option in yaml file to true and run as (possible with GISO for eXR variants of IOS-XR):

    ./src/gisobuild.py --yamlfile <input_yaml_cfg>

where input_yaml_cfg has:

    docker: true

Output:

The corresponding GISO and build logs are available under the directory
specified in `--out-directory`. The default if not specified is
`<pwd>/output_gisobuild`.


# Note: older version of the tool

The legacy eXR python2-based gisobuild utility is available at:

 https://github.com/ios-xr/gisobuild/tree/gisobuild-exr-legacy

The command to pull the above code base is:

    git clone  --branch gisobuild-exr-legacy https://github.com/ios-xr/gisobuild/
